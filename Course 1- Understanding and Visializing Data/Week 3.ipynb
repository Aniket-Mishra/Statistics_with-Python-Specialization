    "## Pitfall: Simpson's Paradox\n",
    "In this section, we’re going to introduce a Pitfall within Statistics: Simpson’s Paradox.\n",
    "\n",
    "What if I told you that the rate of completing Course 2 after you’ve completed Course 1 of a Specialization is higher for males than for females? What would you think?\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, what if I told you that more males are enrolled in a full Specialization, while more females are interested in taking each course as a freestanding course? Does that change how you think about the situation?\n",
    "\n",
    "What might actually be happening is that there are different rates of Course 2 completion for those in the Specialization versus those taking freestanding courses, and that the gender ratio may also be different for those two situations."

    "        Specialization\tCourse\t     Total\n",
    "Men\t    55/70 (79%)\t    10/20 (50%)\t 65/90 (72%)\n",
    "Women\t25/30 (83%)\t    17/30 (57%)\t 42/60 (70%)\n",
    "Total\t80/100 (80%)\t27/50 (54%)\t\n",
    "\n",
    "You may notice that the completion rate of Course 2 is higher for women within each of the methods of taking this course, but overall it appears that the completion rate of Course 2 is higher for men. The way of taking courses hides the true direction of the relationship between gender and completion rate of Course 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "The method of taking the course can be considered a confounding variable. A confounding variable is an outside influence that changes the relationship between the independent and the dependent variable. It oftentimes works by affecting the causal relationship between the primary independent variable and the dependent variable. This confounding variable confuses the relationship between two other variables; it may act by hiding, obscuring, or enhancing the existing relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose that you are interested in examining how activity level affects weight change. Other factors, like diet, age, and gender may also affect weight change and come into play when looking at the relationship between activity level and weight change. If one doesn’t control for these factors, the relationship between activity level and weight change can be distorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "This also serves as a reminder that Correlation does not imply Causation. There may be other factors involved with a causal relationship. For this reason, you shouldn’t place too much stock in correlation alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many other examples of Simpson’s Paradox, including [this article on the relationship between gender and Nobel prize awards](https://www.significancemagazine.com/science/294-the-nobel-prize-gender-gap?highlight=WyJwYXJhZG94Il0=). In the next discussion, you’ll have a chance to think about some examples of Simpson’s Paradox in your daily life."

    "Modern Ways to Visualize Data\n",
    "In this course, we have focused on visualizations like box plots, histograms, bar charts, pie charts, and scatterplots. But these are not the only ways to visualize data. As data becomes more complex and as people try to present data in more interesting and readable ways, new visualizations have emerged. Feel free to check out the links below for some cool examples.\n",

    "## A Few Notes for Providing High Quality Peer Review\n",
    "1. Use respectful language whether you are suggesting improvements to or praising your peer.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Look over your peer’s memo to quickly get an overview of the piece.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Next, read the memo more slowly keeping the rubric in mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. As you re-read, note the pieces of texts that let you directly address the rubric prompts in your online responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. In your online responses, focus on larger issues (higher order concerns) of content and argument rather than lower order concerns like grammar and spelling.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Be very specific in your responses, referring to your peer’s actual language, mentioning terms and concepts that are either present or missing, and following the directions in the rubric.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Peer Review is important and helpful (to both the reviewer and receiver of the review), so be sure your online responses are detailed enough (minimum word count for each of the 4 criteria is 30 words).\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Peer Review is most helpful if received in a timely basis. Complete your thoughtful online feedback for all your assigned submissions ASAP so you can provide that feedback and thus earn your points for this helpful exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Grading Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "1. This memorandum should be written to be understandable to the company's CEO who has basic statistical literacy. Comment on whether this was achieved. What parts were written well? What parts would be more difficult to understand?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The study design should be described in this memo. Comment on proposed research questions or claims that would be addressed. What is described well? What is missing? How might the description be improved?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Comment on the proposed variables that would be recorded. What is described well? What is missing? How might the description be improved? Do they generally align well with the proposed research questions or claims? Is there enough detail so the company's CEO will generally understand what is proposed to be measured and how it would be measured?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Comment on the proposed graphical and numerical summaries. What is described well? What is missing? How might the descriptions be improved? Do they generally align well with the proposed research questions or claims? Do they align with the type of data that is being recorded?"

Being in a recidential area in the outskirts, families with kids will often shop for ingredients and other things from the market complex and targetting them will help promote  our pizzeria. There is no better advertisement method than a loyal and satisfied customer. So, we should start by seeing what our customers want and what our kitchen can provide. Then we can use that information to come up with a plan to beat our competition, **Evil Company**.\n",

    "Phase 1:\n",
    "We can take a survey from our kitchen to see if they are comfortable working in an open kitchen. \n",

    "1. Since families will tend to visit the pizzeria with their kids, an open kitchen will be facinating to them and if we entertain them right, they will visit us again.\n",
    "2. It will increase the trust between the kitchen and the customers as they can come and see how their food is being prepared.\n",

    "1. it makes our pizzeria unique\n",
    "2. It will help us build a brand image.\n",
    "3. This allows customers to combine their preferred meats and vegetables for their pizza, letting them have fun while eating.\n",
    "However! we must first test what combinations go well with each other and take advice from the chef so that people don't end up combining something that will not taste good and would give us a bad name. It can be something like a sub, the customer can choose between the crust, the cheese and the toppings, combining some toppings. and so on.\n",

    "Phase 3:\n",
    "We can then check for patterns of what pizzas are sold most on what days and at what time, which sides are ordered most with what kind and size of pizza and see if we have any returning and regular customers. Using this informtion, we can create deals with discounts with pizzas and sides, special discounts for regular customers, like giving them a regular customer card that they can use to avail discounts on their orders and give them free home delivery and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "Phase 4:\n",
