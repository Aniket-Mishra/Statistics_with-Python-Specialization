    "Suppose that a researcher believes that a person’s income is a function of their age and years of education. The researcher collects measures of annual income, age, and years of education from a random sample of adults in a small community. The researcher wishes to fit a linear regression model that takes the following form: income = a + b × age + c × education + e, where the errors are assumed to follow a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance σ^2. Which of the following statements is true?\n",
