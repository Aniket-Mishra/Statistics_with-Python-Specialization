    "In previous years, 52% of parents believed that electronics and social media was the cause of their teenager's lack of sleep. Do more parents today believe that their teenager's lack of sleep is caused due to electronics and social media?\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Population: Parents with teenages aged 13-18 <br>\n",
    "Parameter of interest = p or the population proportion <br>\n",
    "**Test for a significance increase in the proportion of parents with a teenager who believe that electronics and social media is the cause for lack of sleep.** <br>\n",
    "### We set our hypothesis first, even before we collect our data so that we do not influence in what we believe.\n",

    "H0 : Null Hypothesis : p = 0.52 -> Lack of sleep is caused by electronics<br>\n",

    "alpha = 0.05 -> Significance level : When we find something to be significant when p is < 0.05 : cutoff point <br>\n",
